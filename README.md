# Pattern-Recognition-Classifiers-Bayes-SVM
Given a set of faces and their labels, implement different classifiers to achieve facial recognition. The classifiers implemented- a) Bayesâ€™ Classifier b) K-NN Rule Classifier c) SVM d) Boosted SVM    Principal Component Analysis(PCA) and Multiple Discriminant Analysis(MDA) before applying the data to each classifier
